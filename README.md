# Predicting-loan-cases-using-Decision-Tree

Loan Prediction Project

This project aims to predict whether a loan application will get approved or not based on applicant details provided in the dataset.

Data

The dataset is obtained from Analytics Vidhya's loan prediction hackathon. It contains details like gender, marital status, income, loan amount, credit history etc. for over 600 applicants.



The following methods are used in this project:

Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Handling missing values

Encoding categorical variables

Outlier treatment

Feature scaling

Machine Learning (Supervised Classification)

Decision Tree model

Model evaluation using confusion matrix, classification metrics 

Usage
The Jupyter notebook contains detailed code and analysis for the project. The main steps are:

Import libraries and dataset

Data analysis and visualization

Data preprocessing

Train-test split

Fit decision tree model

Make predictions and evaluate model performance
